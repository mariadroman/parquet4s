# Examples

Please check [examples](https://github.com/mjakubowski84/parquet4s/blob/master/examples) where you can find simple code covering basics for `core`, `pekko` and `fs2` modules.

Moreover, examples contain two simple applications comprising Pekko Streams or FS2 and Kafka. They show how you can write partitioned Parquet files with data coming from an indefinite stream.
